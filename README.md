Hi 👋

These LeetCode solutions were written as part of my problem-solving and learning journey. I often use ChatGPT as a learning assistant for writing explanations and initial code drafts. However, I personally review, modify, and optimize the solutions, including analyzing time and space complexity where needed. The goal of this repository is to document my learning process and continuously improve my problem-solving skills.

🧠 MY LEARNING FLOW

1. Understand the Question  
2. Discuss the Problem with ChatGPT if my understanding is right or wrong  
3. Write and Discuss Pseudocode with ChatGPT  
4. Implement the Code in Python with ChatGPT  
5. Make Small Improvements and Take Help from Youtube Tutorials
6. Analyze Time and Space Complexity  
7. Reflect and Optimize

I’ve kept all comments and explanations (including those generated by ChatGPT) intact for clarity and organization. This way, anyone reviewing the code (especially myself) can easily understand the logic, reasoning, and optimizations behind each solution whenever needed.

Happy Problem Solving! 😊 Thanks for visiting!
